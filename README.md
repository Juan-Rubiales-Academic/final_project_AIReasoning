## About the Project

This project demonstrates the application of AI algorithms in the domain of board games. The primary goal was to create engines that can play these games with a certain level of intelligence, leveraging strategies such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and more.

## Games Included

### 1. Clobber

- **Notebook**: `Clobber_algorithm.ipynb`
- **Description**: Clobber is a two-player abstract strategy game where the goal is to capture the opponent's pieces. The AI implemented here aims to play optimally using strategic evaluations.

### 2. Connect4

- **Notebook**: `Connect4_algorithm.ipynb`
- **Description**: Connect4 is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The AI implemented uses various algorithms to decide the best moves.

### 3. Gin Rummy

- **Notebook**: `Gin_Rummy_Final.ipynb`
- **Description**: Gin Rummy is a popular two-player card game. The AI implemented here seeks to minimize the score difference with the opponent through optimal card selection and discard strategies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/AI-Board-Games-Engines.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AI-Board-Games-Engines
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each game has its own Jupyter Notebook, where you can run the AI algorithms and observe their performance. To get started, simply open the desired notebook and follow the instructions provided within.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the respective game folder and open the notebook to start experimenting with the AI engines.
