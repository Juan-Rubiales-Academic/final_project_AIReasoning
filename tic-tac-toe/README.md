# Algorithms_AI_Project

Our Algoritms project is a connect game. We have created two options to play, either with an AI or vs another player. 
Also, we have given the chance to select either connect 3, connect 4 or connect 5, being the players choice which one to play.

The algorithms use are:
First algorithm Backtracking algorithm for checking the empty spots in the array of three dimensions.
Second algorithm Minimax algorithm for the AI to be able to play, it uses recursive and backtracking foundations. 
We added two values fo the search: alpha-value (associated with MAX nodes) and beta-value (associate with MIN nodes).
